# Things About Me

A reference guide for when people say stupid stuff to me on the internet.

## 1
I am not your average person - I contain multitudes and contradictions that make perfect sense to me.

## 2  
Your assumptions about me are probably wrong, and that's okay - I'd rather be misunderstood than boring.

## 3
I believe in being authentically chaotic rather than performatively normal.

## 4
If you're here because you said something stupid to me on social media, maybe reflect on that.

## 5
I'm probably more complex than whatever box you tried to put me in.

## 6
I don't owe you consistency - I reserve the right to evolve, contradict myself, and change my mind.

## 7
My existence is not a debate topic, and I'm not here to justify myself to strangers on the internet.

## 8
I curate my online presence for my own enjoyment, not for your approval or understanding.

## 9
If you don't like what I post, the unfollow button is free and readily available.

## 10
I'm allowed to have opinions, feelings, and experiences that don't align with your worldview.
